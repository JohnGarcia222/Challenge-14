# ***Machine Learning Algorithm***

Within challenge 14 we will incorporate a machine learning model to pre-existing algorithmic trading bots to improve and maintain an upperhand.

----------------------------

## Technologies

__Libraries__: pandas, hvplot, numpy, pathlib, sklearn, sklearn.metrics, sklearn.preprocessing, matplotlib, warnings   
__Framework__: Jupyterlab  
__Operating Systems__: Mac OS, Microsoft Windows  
__Programming Language__: Python  

-----------------------------

## Installation and Usage

1. Copy the repository

![RUNCHA14](https://github.com/JohnGarcia222/Challenge-14/assets/127170402/5268676d-8460-4f9e-9e00-3904225fd1c2)

2. Clone the repository to a folder through your terminal

```git clone https://github.com/JohnGarcia222/Challenge-14.git```

3. Navigate to and run the repository through Jupyterlab

```cd '.\Challenge 14\'```
```Jupyterlab```

4. Click the start button towards the top of the screen and run all cells

![run](https://github.com/JohnGarcia222/Challenge-14/assets/127170402/8f7f8f19-4d06-4304-a324-a3e06359ba3f)

## Results

***Original Data Set***

***Data Set after change (New)***

![new](https://github.com/JohnGarcia222/Challenge-14/assets/127170402/247e8d10-9cb7-471c-95ba-7e94a6169e59)

------------------------------

## Summary

If you are to look at the ***Results*** section of the READ.me you can see that in the original data set the "Actual Returns" and the "Strategy Returns" stick fairly close together with almost the same highs and lows. While the original section of the data runs pretty well, the ML model flips the "Strategy Returns" on its head, essentially killing the data set. Even though the ML model worked to make predict changes to the best of its ability, the original data/model was a much safer choice.
